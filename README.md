# Bayesian Hierarchical Detection of Dark Matter from Overheated Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs

Here we make available the Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) tailored for the detection of dark matter (DM) particles via their potential effect in overheating exoplanets and brown dwars as presented in [Benito et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2024.XXXXX).

The data provided in this repository is sourced from the ATMO model developed by [Phillips et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...637A..38P/abstract), available in the form of a text file.
